# PyCoin
My project/creation of Bitcoin from scratch using Python (yes, the name is a little lazy, lol).

This is currently VERY incomplete, but the idea was to make Bitcoin from scratch (although I don't endorse crypto, lol).
As it is right now, blocks can technically be mined (as nonce-solving works), as well as ECDSA (DER Encoding needs to be fixed).
There also is some merkle tree functionality, although limited. The plan is to eventually come back to this once I have the time,
as I'm currently busy with university.
